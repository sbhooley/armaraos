# ArmaraOS Architecture

This document describes the internal architecture of ArmaraOS, the open-source Agent Operating System built in Rust. It covers the crate structure, kernel boot sequence, agent lifecycle, memory substrate, LLM driver abstraction, capability-based security model, the OFP wire protocol, the security hardening stack, the channel and skill systems, and the agent stability subsystems.

Default on-disk paths use **`~/.armaraos/`** as the data home (see [`data-directory.md`](data-directory.md)).

## AINL as default implementation language

ArmaraOS treats **AI Native Language (AINL)** as the **first-class** language for new **programs, workflows, and apps** (`.ainl` graphs and related assets). The **kernel and core services** remain **Rust**; AINL is the default for orchestration and user-facing automation unless a stakeholder **explicitly** chooses another language or constraints require it.

See **[AINL first (policy)](ainl-first-language.md)** for the full principle, exceptions, and rationale.

Embedded operator graphs under `programs/` (materialized to `~/.armaraos/ainl-library/armaraos-programs/`) and their curated Scheduler wiring are summarized in **[AINL showcases](ainl-showcases.md)**.

---

## Crate Structure

ArmaraOS is organized as a Cargo workspace with 14 crates (13 code crates + xtask). Dependencies flow downward (lower crates depend on nothing above them).

### Crate Responsibilities

| Crate | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **openfang-types** | Core type definitions used across all crates. Defines `AgentManifest`, `AgentId`, `Capability`, `Event`, `ToolDefinition`, `KernelConfig`, `ArmaraOSError`, taint tracking (`TaintLabel`, `TaintSet`), Ed25519 manifest signing, model catalog types (`ModelCatalogEntry`, `ProviderInfo`, `ModelTier`), tool compatibility mappings (21 OpenClaw-to-ArmaraOS), MCP/A2A config types, and web config types. All config structs use `#[serde(default)]` for forward-compatible TOML parsing. |
| **openfang-memory** | SQLite-backed memory substrate (schema v8+). Uses an `r2d2` connection pool (`MemorySqlitePool`, WAL + configurable `busy_timeout`) with `spawn_blocking` for async bridging. Provides structured KV storage, semantic search with vector embeddings, knowledge graph (entities and relations), session management, task board, usage event persistence (`usage_events` table, `UsageStore`), and canonical sessions for cross-channel memory. |
| **openfang-runtime** | Agent execution engine. Contains the agent loop (`run_agent_loop`, `run_agent_loop_streaming`), 3 native LLM drivers (Anthropic, Gemini, OpenAI-compatible covering 20 providers), 23 built-in tools, WASM sandbox (Wasmtime with dual fuel+epoch metering), MCP client/server (JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio/SSE), A2A protocol (AgentCard, task management), web search engine (4 providers: Tavily/Brave/Perplexity/DuckDuckGo), web fetch with SSRF protection, loop guard (SHA256-based tool loop detection), session repair (history validation), LLM session compactor (block-aware), Merkle hash chain audit trail, and embedding driver. Defines the `KernelHandle` trait that enables inter-agent tools without circular crate dependencies. |
| **openfang-kernel** | The central coordinator. `OpenFangKernel` assembles all subsystems: `AgentRegistry`, `AgentScheduler`, `CapabilityManager`, `EventBus`, `Supervisor`, `WorkflowEngine`, `TriggerEngine`, `BackgroundExecutor`, `WasmSandbox`, `ModelCatalog`, `MeteringEngine`, `ModelRouter`, `AuthManager` (RBAC), `HeartbeatMonitor`, `SetupWizard`, `SkillRegistry`, MCP connections, and `WebToolsContext`. Implements `KernelHandle` for inter-agent operations. Handles agent spawn/kill, message dispatch, workflow execution, trigger evaluation, capability inheritance validation, and graceful shutdown with state persistence. |
| **openfang-api** | HTTP API server built on Axum 0.8. Routes for agents, workflows, triggers, memory, channels, templates, models, providers, skills, ClawHub, MCP, health, status, version, shutdown, ArmaraOS home browser, audit and **log** streams (`/api/logs/stream`, `/api/logs/daemon/*`), and more (see [api-reference.md](api-reference.md)). WebSocket handler for real-time agent chat with streaming. Multiple SSE endpoints (agent message stream, kernel events, audit log, daemon tracing tail). OpenAI-compatible endpoints (`POST /v1/chat/completions`, `GET /v1/models`). A2A endpoints (`/.well-known/agent.json`, `/a2a/*`). Middleware: Bearer token auth, request ID injection, structured request logging, GCRA rate limiter (cost-aware), security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.), health endpoint redaction, loopback exceptions for selected SSE and support routes. Serves the embedded Alpine.js dashboard from `static/` (`index_body.html`, `js/pages/`, `css/`). The **Get started** landing page (`#overview`) — section order, Quick actions, Setup Wizard gating, checklist — is documented in [dashboard-overview-ui.md](dashboard-overview-ui.md); **Settings** / **Runtime** dashboard shell in [dashboard-settings-runtime-ui.md](dashboard-settings-runtime-ui.md). **Notification center** (bell + panel, approvals/budget/kernel rows, command palette entry, layout gutter) — [dashboard-testing.md](dashboard-testing.md#notification-center-bell). |
| **openfang-channels** | Channel bridge layer with 40 adapters. Each adapter implements the `ChannelAdapter` trait. Includes: Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Signal, Matrix, Email, SMS, Webhook, Teams, Mattermost, IRC, Google Chat, Twitch, Rocket.Chat, Zulip, XMPP, LINE, Viber, Messenger, Reddit, Mastodon, Bluesky, Feishu, Revolt, Nextcloud, Guilded, Keybase, Threema, Nostr, Webex, Pumble, Flock, Twist, Mumble, DingTalk, Discourse, Gitter, Ntfy, Gotify, LinkedIn. Features: `AgentRouter` for message routing, `BridgeManager` for lifecycle coordination, `ChannelRateLimiter` (per-user DashMap tracking), `formatter.rs` (Markdown to TelegramHTML/SlackMrkdwn/PlainText), `ChannelOverrides` (model/system_prompt/dm_policy/group_policy/rate_limit/threading/output_format), DM/group policy enforcement. |
| **openfang-wire** | OpenFang Protocol (OFP) for peer-to-peer agent communication. JSON-framed messages over TCP with HMAC-SHA256 mutual authentication (nonce + constant-time verify via `subtle`). `PeerNode` listens for connections and manages peers. `PeerRegistry` tracks known remote peers and their agents. |
| **openfang-cli** | Clap-based CLI. Supports all commands: `init`, `start`, `status`, `doctor`, `agent spawn/list/chat/kill`, `workflow list/create/run`, `trigger list/create/delete`, `migrate`, `skill install/list/remove/search/create`, `channel list/setup/test/enable/disable`, `config show/edit`, `chat`, `mcp`, `gateway`, etc. Daemon auto-detect: checks `~/.armaraos/daemon.json` and health pings; uses HTTP when a daemon is running, boots an in-process kernel as fallback. **`openfang start`** (and **`gateway start`**) mirror `tracing` to **stderr** and **`~/.armaraos/logs/daemon.log`** for dashboard/API tailing; TUI/chat uses **`tui.log`** instead. Built-in MCP server mode. |
| **openfang-desktop** | Tauri 2.0 native desktop application. Boots the kernel in-process, runs the axum server on a background thread, and points a WebView at `http://127.0.0.1:{random_port}`. Features: system tray (Show/Browser/Status/Quit), single-instance enforcement, desktop notifications, hide-to-tray on close. IPC commands: `get_port`, `get_status`. Mobile-ready with `#[cfg(desktop)]` guards. |
| **openfang-migrate** | Migration engine. Supports OpenClaw (`~/.openclaw/`). Converts YAML configs to TOML, maps tool names, maps provider names, imports agent manifests, copies memory files, converts channel configs. Produces a `MigrationReport` with imported items, skipped items, and warnings. |
| **openfang-skills** | Skill system for pluggable tool bundles. 60 bundled skills compiled via `include_str!()`. Skills are `skill.toml` + Python/WASM/Node.js/PromptOnly code. `SkillManifest` defines metadata, runtime config, provided tools, and requirements. `SkillRegistry` manages installed and bundled skills. `FangHubClient` connects to FangHub marketplace. `ClawHubClient` connects to clawhub.ai for cross-ecosystem skill discovery. `SKILL.md` parser for OpenClaw compatibility (YAML frontmatter + Markdown body). `SkillVerifier` with SHA256 verification. Prompt injection scanner (`scan_prompt_content()`) detects override attempts, data exfiltration, and shell references. |
| **xtask** | Build automation tasks (cargo-xtask pattern). |

---

## Kernel Boot Sequence

When `OpenFangKernel::boot_with_config()` is called (either by the daemon or in-process by the CLI/desktop app), the following sequence executes:

```
1. Load configuration
   - Read ~/.armaraos/config.toml (or specified path)
   - Apply #[serde(default)] defaults for missing fields
   - Validate config and log warnings (missing API keys, etc.)

2. Create data directory
   - Ensure ~/.armaraos/data/ exists

3. Initialize memory substrate
   - Open SQLite database (openfang.db)
   - Run schema migrations (up to v5)
   - Set memory decay rate

4. Initialize LLM driver
   - Read API key from environment variable
   - Create driver for the configured provider
   - Validate driver config

5. Initialize model catalog
   - Build ModelCatalog with 51 builtin models, 20+ aliases, 20 providers
   - Run detect_auth() to check env var presence (never reads secrets)
   - Store as kernel.model_catalog

6. Initialize metering engine
   - Create MeteringEngine with cost catalog (20+ model families)
   - Wire to model catalog for pricing source

7. Initialize model router
   - Create ModelRouter with TaskComplexity scoring
   - Validate configured models and resolve aliases

8. Initialize core subsystems
   - AgentRegistry (DashMap-based concurrent agent store)
   - CapabilityManager (DashMap-based capability grants)
   - EventBus (async broadcast channel)
   - AgentScheduler (quota tracking per agent, hourly window reset)
   - Supervisor (health monitoring, panic/restart counters)
   - WorkflowEngine (workflow registration and execution, run eviction cap 200)
   - TriggerEngine (event pattern matching)
   - BackgroundExecutor (continuous/periodic agent loops)
   - WasmSandbox (Wasmtime engine, dual fuel+epoch metering)

9. Initialize RBAC auth manager
   - Create AuthManager with UserRole hierarchy
   - Set up channel identity resolution

10. Initialize skill registry
    - Load 60 bundled skills via parse_bundled()
    - Load user-installed skills from disk
    - Wire skill tools into tool_runner fallback chain
    - Inject PromptOnly skill context into system prompts

11. Initialize web tools context
    - Create WebSearchEngine (4-provider cascading: Tavily->Brave->Perplexity->DDG)
    - Create WebFetchEngine (SSRF-protected)
    - Bundle as WebToolsContext

12. Restore persisted agents
    - Load all agents from SQLite
    - Re-register in memory (registry, capabilities, scheduler)
    - Set state to Running

13. Publish KernelStarted event

14. Return kernel instance
```

When the daemon wraps the kernel in `Arc`, additional steps occur:

```
15. Set self-handle (weak Arc reference for trigger dispatch)

16. Connect to MCP servers
    - Background connect to configured MCP servers (stdio/SSE)
    - Namespace tools as mcp_{server}_{tool}
    - Store connections in kernel.mcp_connections

17. Start heartbeat monitor
    - Background tokio task for agent health checks
    - Publishes HealthCheckFailed events on anomalies

18. Start background agent loops (continuous, periodic, proactive)
```

## Agent Lifecycle

### States

```
    spawn                    message/tick              kill
      |                         |                       |
      v                         v                       v
  [Running] <------------> [Running] ---------> [Terminated]
      |                                              ^
      |          shutdown                            |
      +----------> [Suspended] ---------------------+
                      |          reboot/restore
                      +------> [Running]
```

- **Running**: Agent is active and can receive messages.
- **Suspended**: Agent is paused (e.g., during daemon shutdown). Persisted to SQLite for restore on next boot.
- **Terminated**: Agent has been killed. Removed from registry and persistent storage.

### Spawn Flow

1. Generate new `AgentId` (UUID v4) and `SessionId`.
2. Create a session in the memory substrate.
3. Parse the manifest and extract capabilities.
4. Validate capability inheritance (`validate_capability_inheritance()` prevents privilege escalation).
5. Grant capabilities via `CapabilityManager`.
6. Register with the `AgentScheduler` (quota tracking).
7. Create `AgentEntry` and register in `AgentRegistry`.
8. Persist to SQLite via `memory.save_agent()`.
9. If agent has a parent, update parent's children list.
10. Register proactive triggers (if schedule mode is `Proactive`).
11. Publish `Lifecycle::Spawned` event and evaluate triggers.

### Message Flow

1. **RBAC check**: `AuthManager` resolves channel identity and checks user role permissions.
2. **Channel policy check**: `ChannelBridgeHandle.authorize_channel_user()` enforces DM/group policy.
3. **Quota check**: `AgentScheduler` verifies the agent has not exceeded its token-per-hour limit.
4. **Entry lookup**: Fetch `AgentEntry` from the registry.
5. **Module dispatch**: Based on `manifest.module`:
   - `builtin:chat` or unrecognized: LLM agent loop
   - `wasm:path/to/module.wasm`: WASM sandbox execution (**`tool_turns`** / HTTP **`tools`** are empty — no LLM tool loop)
   - `python:path/to/script.py`: Python subprocess execution (env_clear() + selective vars) (**same**: empty **`tool_turns`**)
6. **LLM agent loop** (for `builtin:chat`):
   a. Load or create session from memory.
   b. Load canonical context summary (cross-channel memory) into system prompt.
   c. Append stability guidelines to system prompt.
   d. Resolve LLM driver (per-agent override or kernel default).
   e. Gather available tools (filtered by capabilities + skill tools + MCP tools).
   f. Initialize loop guard (tool loop detection).
   g. Run session repair (validate and fix message history).
   h. Run iterative loop: send messages to LLM, execute tool calls, accumulate results.
   i. Auto-compact session if threshold exceeded (block-aware compaction).
   j. Save updated session and canonical session back to memory.
7. **Cost estimation**: `MeteringEngine.estimate_cost_with_catalog()` computes cost in USD.
8. **Record usage**: Update quota tracking with token counts; persist usage event.
9. **Return result**: `AgentLoopResult` with response text, token usage, iteration count, optional `cost_usd`, and **`tool_turns`** — a flat list of tool executions for the turn (`ToolTurnRecord` in `openfang-types`) so **`POST /api/agents/{id}/message`** can expose **`tools`** to HTTP clients without WebSocket `tool_*` events.

### Kill Flow

1. Check caller has `AgentKill(target_name)` capability.
2. Remove from `AgentRegistry`.
3. Stop background loops via `BackgroundExecutor`.
4. Unregister from `AgentScheduler`.
5. Revoke all capabilities.
6. Unsubscribe from `EventBus`.
7. Remove triggers.
8. Remove from persistent storage (SQLite).

---

## Agent Loop Stability

The agent loop includes multiple hardening layers to prevent runaway behavior:

### Loop Guard

`LoopGuard` detects when an agent is stuck calling the same tool with the same parameters. Uses SHA256 hashing of `(tool_name, params)` to identify repetition.

- **Warn threshold** (default 3): Logs a warning and injects a hint to the LLM.
- **Block threshold** (default 5): Refuses the tool call and returns an error to the LLM.
- **Circuit breaker** (default 30): Terminates the agent loop entirely.

Configured via `LoopGuardConfig`.

### Session Repair

`validate_and_repair()` runs before each agent loop iteration to ensure message history consistency:

- Drops orphaned `ToolResult` messages (no matching `ToolUse`).
- Removes empty messages.
- Merges consecutive same-role messages.

### Tool Result Truncation

`truncate_tool_result()` enforces a 50,000 character hard cap on tool output. Truncated results include a marker showing the original size.

### Tool Timeout

All tool executions are wrapped in a universal 60-second `tokio::time::timeout`. Tools that exceed this limit return a timeout error to the LLM rather than hanging indefinitely.

### Max Continuations

`MAX_CONTINUATIONS = 3` prevents infinite "Please continue" loops. After 3 continuation attempts, the agent returns its partial response rather than requesting another round.

### Inter-Agent Depth Limit

`MAX_AGENT_CALL_DEPTH = 5` enforced via `tokio::task_local!` in the tool runner. Prevents unbounded recursive agent-to-agent calls.

### Stability Guidelines

`STABILITY_GUIDELINES` are appended to every agent's system prompt. These contain anti-loop and anti-retry behavioral rules that the LLM follows to avoid degenerate patterns.

### Block-Aware Compaction

The session compactor handles all content block types (Text, ToolUse, ToolResult, Image) rather than assuming text-only messages. Auto-compaction triggers when the session exceeds the configured threshold (default 80% of context window), keeping the most recent messages (default 20).

---

## Memory Substrate

The memory substrate (`openfang-memory`) provides six layers of storage:

### 1. Structured KV Store

Per-agent key-value storage backed by SQLite. Keys are strings, values are JSON. Used by the `memory_store` and `memory_recall` tools.

A shared memory namespace (fixed agent ID `00000000-...01`) enables cross-agent data sharing.

```
agent_id | key         | value
---------|-------------|------------------
uuid-a   | preferences | {"theme": "dark"}
uuid-b   | state       | {"step": 3}
shared   | project     | {"name": "foo"}
```

### 2. Semantic Search

Vector embeddings for similarity-based memory retrieval. Documents are embedded using the configured embedding driver and stored with their vectors. Queries are embedded at search time and matched by cosine similarity.

### 3. Knowledge Graph

Entity-relation storage for structured knowledge. Agents can store entities (with types and properties) and relations between them. Supports graph traversal queries.

### 4. Session Manager

Conversation history storage. Each agent has a session containing its message history (user, assistant, tool use, tool result, image). Sessions track context window token counts. Sessions are persisted to SQLite and restored on kernel reboot.

### 5. Task Board

A shared task queue for multi-agent collaboration:
- `task_post`: Create a task with title, description, and optional assignee.
- `task_claim`: Claim the next available task.
- `task_complete`: Mark a task as done with a result.
- `task_list`: List tasks filtered by status (pending, claimed, completed).

### 6. Usage and Canonical Sessions

- **Usage tracking**: `usage_events` table persists token counts, cost estimates, and model usage per agent. `UsageStore` provides query and aggregation APIs.
- **Canonical sessions**: Cross-channel memory. `CanonicalSession` tracks a user's conversation context across multiple channels. Compaction produces summaries that are injected into system prompts. Stored in `canonical_sessions` table (schema v5).

### SQLite architecture

Concurrent access uses **`r2d2` + `r2d2_sqlite`** (`MemorySqlitePool`): multiple pooled `rusqlite` connections share one database file (WAL mode). The public `Memory` trait is unchanged; async entry points still use `spawn_blocking` so the Tokio runtime is not blocked on SQLite.

**`[memory]` options** (see `MemoryConfig` in `openfang-types`; defaults keep existing behavior):

| Field | Default | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `max_connections` | `16` | Pool size (`r2d2` `max_size`, clamped 1–512). |
| `acquire_timeout_ms` | `30000` | Max wait to obtain a connection from the pool. |
| `busy_timeout_ms` | `5000` | SQLite `busy_timeout` (retries on `SQLITE_BUSY`). |
| `shard_mode` | `"single"` | Stub for future per-workspace or per-agent shards; only `single` is implemented. |

Schema migrations run once on disk-backed databases before the pool is exposed; in-memory test pools migrate on the first pooled connection so shared-cache `:memory:` databases are not dropped prematurely.

---

## Runtime limits (`[runtime_limits]`)

Global defaults live in `config.toml` under **`[runtime_limits]`** (`RuntimeLimitsConfig` in `openfang-types`). The kernel keeps a hot-reloadable snapshot (`runtime_limits_live`); each agent turn builds an **`EffectiveRuntimeLimits`** from that snapshot plus optional **per-agent manifest `[metadata]`** overrides.

| Key (TOML) | Default | Notes |
|------------|---------|--------|
| `max_iterations` | `80` | Used when the agent has no `[autonomous].max_iterations`. |
| `max_continuations` | `5` | Consecutive `MaxTokens` stops before partial reply. |
| `max_history_messages` | `60` | Pre-LLM trim of session messages. |
| `max_agent_call_depth` | `5` | Nested `agent_send` depth (task-local in `tool_runner`). |
| `workflow_max_retained_runs` | `200` | In-memory workflow run map cap. |
| `workflow_run_ttl_secs` | *(unset)* | Optional TTL for completed/failed runs (seconds). |
| `allow_unbounded_agent_loop` | `false` | With `ARMARAOS_UNBOUNDED=1`, raises ceilings (e.g. 512 / 4096 history). |

**Manifest metadata overrides** (same section, string or number JSON values): `runtime_max_iterations`, `runtime_max_continuations`, `runtime_max_history_messages`, `runtime_max_agent_call_depth`, `runtime_workflow_max_retained_runs`, `runtime_workflow_run_ttl_secs`.

**Bounded mode** (default): values are clamped to safe ceilings (e.g. 64 for iterations/continuations/depth, 1024 history, 512 retained workflow runs). **`allow_unbounded_agent_loop = true`** and **`ARMARAOS_UNBOUNDED=1`** are both required for the higher “absolute max” tier.

**Hot reload**: Changing only `[runtime_limits]` queues `HotAction::UpdateRuntimeLimits` (no daemon restart). In-flight loops keep the limits they started with.

Example:

```toml
[runtime_limits]
max_iterations = 120
max_agent_call_depth = 8
workflow_max_retained_runs = 400
workflow_run_ttl_secs = 604800
```

---

## LLM Driver Abstraction

The `LlmDriver` trait (`openfang-runtime`) provides a unified interface for all LLM providers:

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait LlmDriver: Send + Sync {
    async fn send_message(
        &self,
        model: &str,
        system_prompt: &str,
        messages: &[Message],
        tools: &[ToolDefinition],
    ) -> Result<LlmResponse, ArmaraOSError>;

    async fn send_message_streaming(
        &self,
        model: &str,
        system_prompt: &str,
        messages: &[Message],
        tools: &[ToolDefinition],
        tx: mpsc::Sender<StreamEvent>,
    ) -> Result<LlmResponse, ArmaraOSError>;

    fn key_required(&self) -> bool;
}
```

### Provider Architecture

Three native driver implementations cover all 20 providers with 51 models:

1. **AnthropicDriver**: Native Anthropic Messages API. Handles Claude-specific features (content blocks including images, tool use blocks, streaming deltas). Supports `ContentBlock::Image` with media type validation and 5MB cap.

2. **GeminiDriver**: Native Google Gemini API (v1beta). Uses `x-goog-api-key` auth, `systemInstruction`, `functionDeclarations`, `streamGenerateContent?alt=sse`. Maps Gemini function call responses to the unified `ToolUse` stop reason.

3. **OpenAiCompatDriver**: OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions API. Works with any provider that implements the OpenAI API format. Configured with different base URLs per provider. Covers 18+ providers including OpenAI, DeepSeek, Groq, Mistral, Together, and local runners.

### LLM driver factory (`[llm]`)

The kernel keeps an `LlmDriverFactory` (`openfang-runtime::drivers::factory`) for the process lifetime:

- **`[llm]` in `config.toml`** (`openfang_types::config::LlmConfig`): `driver_isolation` (`shared` default, or `isolated` to skip the LRU), `client_timeout_ms`, `connect_timeout_ms`, `max_cached_drivers` (LRU capacity, default 64). Values are clamped in `KernelConfig::clamp_bounds()`.
- **LRU cache key**: `(provider, normalized base URL, API key fingerprint)` so stable `reqwest::Client` instances are reused across agent turns when keys and endpoints match.
- **Hot-reload**: changing `[llm]` triggers `HotAction::UpdateLlmConfig` — the factory applies the new section and **clears** the LRU so timeouts / isolation take effect without restart.
- **Metrics**: `InstrumentingLlmDriver` records per-provider counters and latency; `GET /api/metrics` appends `llm_requests_total`, `llm_errors_total`, `llm_in_flight`, `llm_latency_seconds_sum`, and `llm_latency_seconds_count` (labels: `provider`).
- **Embeddings**: `create_embedding_driver_with_http` uses the same `build_llm_http_client(&config.llm)` timeouts as chat drivers.
- **Manual load testing**: `cargo run -p xtask -- load-test` (requires `ARMARAOS_LOAD_TEST=1`) drives concurrent memory KV + agent messages against a running daemon, optionally workflow runs, and prints `llm_*` excerpts from `/api/metrics`. **Not for CI** — see [`docs/load-testing.md`](load-testing.md).

### Per-Agent Driver Resolution

Each agent can override the kernel's default provider:

```toml
[model]
provider = "openai"                   # Different from kernel default
model = "gpt-4o"
api_key_env = "OPENAI_API_KEY"        # Custom key env var
base_url = "https://custom.api.com"   # Optional custom endpoint
```

When resolving the driver for an agent:
1. If the agent uses the same provider as the kernel default (and no custom key/URL), reuse the kernel's shared driver instance.
2. Otherwise, create a dedicated driver for that agent.

### Retry and Rate Limiting

LLM calls use exponential backoff for rate-limited (429) and overloaded (529) responses. The retry logic is built into the driver layer. All API key fields use `Zeroizing<String>` for automatic memory wipe on drop.

---

## Model Catalog

The `ModelCatalog` (`openfang-runtime/src/model_catalog.rs`) provides a registry of all known models, providers, and aliases.

### Registry Contents

- **51 builtin models** across 20+ model families (Claude, GPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, Llama, Mixtral, Command, Jamba, Grok, etc.)
- **20+ aliases** for convenience (e.g., `claude` -> `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`, `grok` -> `grok-2`)
- **20 providers** with authentication status detection

### Types

- `ModelCatalogEntry`: Model ID, display name, provider, tier, context window, cost rates.
- `ProviderInfo`: Provider name, driver type, base URL, key env var, auth status.
- `ModelTier`: Frontier, Smart, Balanced, Fast (maps to cost and capability tiers).
- `AuthStatus`: Detected, NotDetected (based on env var presence without reading secrets).

### Integration Points

- **Metering**: `estimate_cost_with_catalog()` uses catalog entries as the pricing source.
- **Router**: `ModelRouter.validate_models()` and `resolve_aliases()` reference the catalog.
- **API**: 4 endpoints (`/api/models`, `/api/models/{id}`, `/api/models/aliases`, `/api/providers`).
- **Channels**: `/models` and `/providers` chat commands via `ChannelBridgeHandle`.

## Capability-Based Security Model

Every agent operation is subject to capability checks. Capabilities are declared in the agent manifest and enforced at runtime.

### Capability Types

```rust
pub enum Capability {
    // Tool access
    ToolInvoke(String),       // Access to a specific tool (e.g., "file_read")
    ToolAll,                  // Access to all tools

    // Memory access
    MemoryRead(String),       // Read scope (e.g., "*", "self.*")
    MemoryWrite(String),      // Write scope

    // Network access
    NetConnect(String),       // Connect to host (e.g., "api.example.com", "*")

    // Agent operations
    AgentSpawn,               // Can spawn new agents
    AgentMessage(String),     // Can message agents matching pattern
    AgentKill(String),        // Can kill agents matching pattern

    // Shell access
    ShellExec(String),        // Can execute shell commands matching pattern

    // OFP networking
    OfpDiscover,              // Can discover remote peers
    OfpConnect(String),       // Can connect to specific peers
    OfpAdvertise,             // Can advertise to peers
}
```

### Capability Inheritance Validation

`validate_capability_inheritance()` prevents privilege escalation when agents spawn child agents. A child agent can never receive capabilities that its parent does not hold. This is enforced at spawn time before any capabilities are granted.

### Manifest Declaration

```toml
[capabilities]
tools = ["file_read", "file_list", "web_fetch"]
memory_read = ["*"]
memory_write = ["self.*"]
network = ["api.anthropic.com"]
shell = []
agent_spawn = false
agent_message = ["coder", "researcher"]
agent_kill = []
ofp_discover = false
ofp_connect = []
```

### Enforcement Flow

```
Tool invocation request
    |
    v
CapabilityManager.check(agent_id, ToolInvoke("file_read"))
    |
    +-- Granted --> Validate path (traversal check) --> Execute tool
    |
    +-- Denied --> Return "Permission denied" error to LLM
```

The `CapabilityManager` uses a `DashMap<AgentId, Vec<Capability>>` for lock-free concurrent access. Capabilities are granted at spawn time (after inheritance validation) and revoked at kill time.

The tool runner also enforces capabilities by filtering the tool list before passing it to the LLM. If the LLM hallucinates a tool name outside the agent's granted list, the tool runner rejects it with a permission error.

## Security Hardening

ArmaraOS implements 16 security systems organized into critical fixes and state-of-the-art defenses:

### Path Traversal Prevention

`safe_resolve_path()` and `safe_resolve_parent()` in WASM host functions prevent directory traversal attacks. Path validation in `tool_runner.rs` (`validate_path`) protects file tools. Capability check runs BEFORE path resolution (deny first, then validate).

### Subprocess Isolation

`subprocess_sandbox.rs` provides a secure execution environment for Python/Node skill runtimes. All subprocess invocations use `cmd.env_clear()` followed by selective environment variable injection, preventing secret leakage.

### SSRF Protection

`is_ssrf_target()` and `is_private_ip()` block requests to private IPs and cloud metadata endpoints (169.254.169.254, etc.). DNS resolution is checked to prevent DNS rebinding attacks. Applied in `host_net_fetch` and `web_fetch.rs`.

### WASM Dual Metering

WASM sandbox uses both Wasmtime fuel metering (instruction count) and epoch interruption (wall-clock timeout via watchdog thread). This prevents both CPU-bound and time-bound runaway modules.

### Merkle Audit Trail

`audit.rs` implements a Merkle hash chain where each audit entry includes a hash of the previous entry. This provides tamper-evident logging of all agent actions.

### Information Flow Taint Tracking

`taint.rs` in `openfang-types` implements taint labels and taint sets. Data from external sources carries taint labels that propagate through operations, enabling information flow analysis.

### Ed25519 Manifest Signing

`manifest_signing.rs` provides Ed25519 digital signatures for agent manifests. Ensures manifest integrity and authenticity.

### OFP HMAC-SHA256 Mutual Auth

Wire protocol authentication uses `hmac_sign(secret, nonce + node_id)` on both handshake sides. Nonce prevents replay attacks. Constant-time verification via the `subtle` crate prevents timing attacks.

### Security Headers Middleware

CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Referrer-Policy, and Permissions-Policy headers on all API responses.

### GCRA Rate Limiter

Generic Cell Rate Algorithm with cost-aware token buckets. Per-IP tracking with stale entry cleanup. Configurable burst and sustained rates.

### Health Endpoint Redaction

Public health endpoint (`/api/health`) returns minimal status. Detailed health (`/api/health/detail`) requires authentication and shows database stats, agent counts, and subsystem status.

### Prompt Injection Scanner

`scan_prompt_content()` in the skills crate detects override attempts, data exfiltration patterns, and shell references in skill content. Applied to all bundled and installed skills and to SKILL.md auto-conversion.

### Secret Zeroization

All LLM driver API key fields use `Zeroizing<String>` from the `zeroize` crate. Keys are automatically wiped from memory when the driver is dropped. `Debug` impls on config structs redact secret fields.

### Localhost-Only Fallback

When no API key is configured, the system falls back to localhost-only mode, preventing accidental exposure of unauthenticated endpoints.

### Loop Guard and Session Repair

See [Agent Loop Stability](#agent-loop-stability) above.

### Security Dependencies

`sha2`, `hmac`, `hex`, `subtle`, `ed25519-dalek`, `rand`, `zeroize`, `governor`

---

## Channel System

The channel system (`openfang-channels`) provides 40 adapters for messaging platform integration.

### Adapter List

| Wave | Channels |
|------|----------|
| **Original (15)** | Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Signal, Matrix, Email, SMS, Webhook, Teams, Mattermost, IRC, Google Chat, Twitch, Rocket.Chat |
| **Wave 2 (8)** | Zulip, XMPP, LINE, Viber, Messenger, Reddit, Mastodon, Bluesky |
| **Wave 3 (8)** | Feishu, Revolt, Nextcloud, Guilded, Keybase, Threema, Nostr, Webex |
| **Wave 4 (9)** | Pumble, Flock, Twist, Mumble, DingTalk, Discourse, Gitter, Ntfy, Gotify, LinkedIn |

### Channel Features

- **Channel Overrides**: Per-channel configuration of model, system prompt, DM policy, group policy, rate limit, threading, and output format.
- **DM/Group Policy**: `DmPolicy` and `GroupPolicy` enums enforce who can interact with agents in direct messages vs. group chats.
- **Formatter**: `formatter.rs` converts Markdown to platform-specific formats (TelegramHTML, SlackMrkdwn, PlainText).
- **Rate Limiter**: `ChannelRateLimiter` with per-user DashMap tracking prevents message flooding.
- **Threading**: `send_in_thread()` trait method for platforms that support threaded conversations.
- **Chat Commands**: `/models`, `/providers`, `/new`, `/compact`, `/model`, `/stop`, `/usage`, `/think` handled by `ChannelBridgeHandle`.

---

## Skill System

The skill system (`openfang-skills`) provides 60 bundled skills and supports external skill installation.

### Skill Types

- **Python**: Python scripts executed in subprocess sandbox.
- **Node.js**: Node.js scripts (OpenClaw compatibility).
- **WASM**: WebAssembly modules executed in the WASM sandbox.
- **PromptOnly**: Skills that inject context into the LLM system prompt without code execution.

### Bundled Skills (60)

Compiled into the binary via `include_str!()` in `bundled.rs`. Three tiers:

- **Tier 1 (8)**: github, docker, web-search, code-reviewer, sql-analyst, git-expert, sysadmin, writing-coach
- **Tier 2 (6)**: kubernetes, terraform, aws, jira, data-analyst, api-tester
- **Tier 3 (6)**: pdf-reader, slack-tools, notion, sentry, mongodb, regex-expert
- **Plus 40 additional skills** added in the expansion phase

### Security Pipeline

All skills pass through a security pipeline before activation:

1. **SHA256 verification** (`SkillVerifier`): Ensures skill content matches its declared hash.
2. **Prompt injection scan** (`scan_prompt_content()`): Detects malicious patterns in skill prompts and descriptions.
3. **Trust boundary markers**: Skill-injected context in system prompts is wrapped with trust boundary markers.
4. **Subprocess env_clear()**: Skill code execution uses environment isolation.

### Ecosystem Bridges

- **FangHub**: Native ArmaraOS marketplace (`FangHubClient`).
- **ClawHub**: Cross-ecosystem compatibility (`ClawHubClient` connects to clawhub.ai).
- **SKILL.md Parser**: Auto-converts OpenClaw SKILL.md format (YAML frontmatter + Markdown body) to `skill.toml`.
- **Tool Compat**: 21 OpenClaw-to-ArmaraOS tool name mappings in `tool_compat.rs`.

---

## MCP and A2A Protocols

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

ArmaraOS implements both MCP client and server:

- **MCP Client** (`mcp.rs`): JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio or SSE transports. Connects to external MCP servers. Tools are namespaced as `mcp_{server}_{tool}` to prevent collisions. Background connection in `start_background_agents()`.
- **MCP Server** (`mcp_server.rs`): Exposes ArmaraOS's 23 built-in tools via the MCP protocol. Enables external tools to use ArmaraOS as a tool provider.
- **Configuration**: `KernelConfig.mcp_servers` (Vec of `McpServerConfigEntry` with name, command, args, env, transport).
- **API**: `/api/mcp/servers` returns configured and connected servers with their tool lists.

### Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A)

Google's A2A protocol for inter-system agent communication:

- **A2A Server** (`a2a.rs`): Publishes `AgentCard` at `/.well-known/agent.json`. Handles task lifecycle (send, get, cancel).
- **A2A Client** (`a2a.rs`): Discovers and communicates with remote A2A-compatible agents.
- **Endpoints**: `/.well-known/agent.json`, `/a2a/agents`, `/a2a/tasks/send`, `/a2a/tasks/{id}`, `/a2a/tasks/{id}/cancel`.
- **Configuration**: `KernelConfig.a2a` (optional `A2aConfig`).

---

## Wire Protocol (OFP)

The OpenFang Protocol (OFP) enables peer-to-peer agent communication across machines.

### Architecture

```
Machine A                          Machine B
+-----------+                      +-----------+
| PeerNode  | ---TCP (JSON)------> | PeerNode  |
| port 4200 | <---TCP (JSON)------ | port 4200 |
+-----------+                      +-----------+
| PeerRegistry |                   | PeerRegistry |
| - Known peers |                  | - Known peers |
| - Remote agents |                | - Remote agents |
+---------------+                  +---------------+
```

### HMAC-SHA256 Mutual Authentication

Before any protocol messages are exchanged, both peers authenticate:

1. Initiator sends `{nonce, node_id, hmac_sign(shared_secret, nonce + node_id)}`.
2. Responder verifies HMAC using constant-time comparison (`subtle` crate).
3. Responder sends its own `{nonce, node_id, hmac}` challenge.
4. Initiator verifies.
5. On mutual success, the connection is established.

Configured via `PeerConfig.shared_secret` (required) and `NetworkConfig.shared_secret` in `config.toml`.

### Protocol Messages

All messages are JSON-framed (newline-delimited JSON over TCP):

```
WireMessage {
    id: UUID,
    sender: PeerId,
    payload: WireRequest | WireResponse
}
```

**Request types:**
- `Discover` -- Request peer information and agent list
- `Advertise` -- Announce local agents to a peer
- `RouteMessage` -- Send a message to a remote agent
- `Ping` -- Keepalive

**Response types:**
- `DiscoverResponse` -- Peer info and agent list
- `RouteResponse` -- Agent's response to a routed message
- `Pong` -- Keepalive response

### PeerRegistry

Tracks all known peers and their advertised agents:

```rust
pub struct PeerEntry {
    pub id: PeerId,
    pub addr: SocketAddr,
    pub agents: Vec<RemoteAgent>,
    pub last_seen: Instant,
}

pub struct RemoteAgent {
    pub agent_id: String,
    pub name: String,
    pub description: String,
    pub tags: Vec<String>,
}
```

### Capability Gating

OFP operations require capabilities:
- `OfpDiscover` -- Required to send discover requests
- `OfpConnect(addr)` -- Required to connect to a specific peer
- `OfpAdvertise` -- Required to advertise agents to peers

---

## Desktop Application

The desktop app (`openfang-desktop`) wraps the full ArmaraOS stack in a native Tauri 2.0 application.

### Architecture

```
+-------------------------------------------+
| Tauri 2.0 Shell                           |
| +---------------------------------------+ |
| | WebView (WebKit/WebView2)             | |
| | -> http://127.0.0.1:{random_port}     | |
| +---------------------------------------+ |
| +---------------------------------------+ |
| | System Tray                           | |
| | Show | Browser | Status | Quit        | |
| +---------------------------------------+ |
| +---------------------------------------+ |
| | Background Thread                     | |
| | +- Own Tokio Runtime                  | |
| |    +- OpenFangKernel (in-process)     | |
| |    +- Axum Server (build_router())    | |
| |    +- ServerHandle { port, shutdown } | |
| +---------------------------------------+ |
+-------------------------------------------+
```

### Features

- **In-process kernel**: No separate daemon needed. The kernel boots inside the app process.
- **Random port**: Avoids port conflicts. Port communicated via IPC command `get_port`.
- **System tray**: Show Window, Open in Browser, Status indicator, Quit. Double-click to show.
- **Single instance**: `tauri-plugin-single-instance` prevents multiple app instances.
- **Notifications**: `tauri-plugin-notification` for desktop alerts.
- **Hide to tray**: Window close hides to tray instead of quitting (desktop platforms).
- **Mobile ready**: `#[cfg(desktop)]` guards on tray and single-instance; `#[cfg_attr(mobile, tauri::mobile_entry_point)]`.
